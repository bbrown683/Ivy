This class is used to draw to the buffers we have instantiated.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Draw\+Buffer.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is used to draw to the buffers we have instantiated. 

Due to the current engine implementation, while we set the engine buffers, we do not actually have a way to draw these to the buffer in an abstract manner, hence the existence of this class to use the data from the vertex, index, and constant buffers to draw to the buffer. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
C\+:/\+Users/\+Ben/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Jade/\+Jade/\+Source/\+Graphics/\+Buffer/Draw\+Buffer.\+h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
