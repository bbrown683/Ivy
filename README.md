Basic DirectX and OpenGL backend, allowing for use of either graphics API, which is currently chosen based on the specific Operating System in use. I am currently thinking of writing a shading language which compiles shaders at runtime into the respective API of choice, to prevent the need of having different shader files for each API that perform the same task.
